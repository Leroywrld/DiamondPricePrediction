# Hello and welcome.
## Introduction
- Here's a minimalistic machine learning project using multilinear regression to predict the prices of diamonds based on jewels' physical characteristics.
- The project runs on a flask application
## Need to Know
### Carat size
- carat denotes the weight of a diamond, not the size.
- one carat equals .20 grams.
### Diamond clarity
- clarity refers to the absence of inclusions and blemishes(*structural imperfections which affect the clarity grading of diamonds*) in diamonds.
The following shows the clarity gradng scale:
- Flawless (FL) No inclusions and no blemishes visible under 10x magnification
- Internally Flawless (IF) No inclusions visible under 10x magnification
- Very, Very Slightly Included (VVS1 and VVS2) Inclusions so slight they are difficult for a skilled grader to see under 10x magnification
- Very Slightly Included (VS1 and VS2) Inclusions are observed with effort under 10x magnification, but can be characterized as minor
- Slightly Included (SI1 and SI2) Inclusions are noticeable under 10x magnification
- Included (I1, I2, and I3) Inclusions are obvious under 10x magnification which may affect transparency and brilliance
### Diamond color grade
- color grade refers to how close diamonds are to colorlessness.
- colorless diamonds are thus valued more than colored ones
- the diamond color scale runs from grade(D) to grade(Z) with (D) being colorless.
### Diamond dimensions
- (x) is the diamter measurement of the diamonds
- table refers to the flat facet on its surface — the large, flat surface facet that you can see when you look at the diamond from above.
- depth refers to the distance from its top table to the culet at its base and is represented as a percentage. This percentage is determined by dividing the diamond’s height by its width.
